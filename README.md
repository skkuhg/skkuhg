## 🚀 About Me

I'm an **Assistant Professor** in Computer Science at Nusa Putra University, Indonesia, with a **core mission**: **transforming research into real-world impact**. I believe that research only has true value when it moves beyond academic papers to create tangible solutions that benefit society. My work in **Machine Learning**, **Software-Defined Networking (SDN)**, and **Quality of Experience (QoE)** focuses on practical implementations that solve real problems across three continents.

### 🎯 Current Focus
- 🔬 **Research**: Hybrid Attention-Gated U-Net with Deep Reinforcement Learning for Dynamic Waste Classification
- 👨‍🏫 **Teaching**: Big Data Analysis, Research Methodology (Master's level)
- 🌱 **Learning**: Advanced AI/ML techniques, LLM applications
- 🚀 **Mission**: Bridging the gap between theoretical research and practical solutions

> *"If research only remains on paper and never translates into real-world applications, it loses its value. Innovation matters most when it makes a difference beyond the pages."*

### 🌍 Academic Journey
- 🇮🇩 **Assistant Professor** @ Nusa Putra University (2024-Present)
- 🇨🇳 **Lecturer** @ Zhejiang A&F University (2023-2024)
- 🇹🇷 **Postdoc Researcher** @ Sabanci University (2021-2022)
- 🇰🇷 **PhD** @ Sungkyunkwan University (2016-2021)

## � Research Philosophy: From Paper to Practice

<div align="center">

### 🎯 **"Research without real-world application is just academic exercise"**

</div>

I firmly believe that **the true measure of research success is not in publications alone, but in how effectively we translate theoretical discoveries into practical solutions**. My approach to research follows a clear principle:

🔬 **Research** → 🛠️ **Development** → 🚀 **Implementation** → 🌍 **Impact**

### Why This Matters:
- **🎯 Purpose-Driven**: Every project targets a real-world problem
- **🔄 Iterative Approach**: Continuous feedback from practical implementation
- **🤝 Collaboration**: Working with industry to ensure applicability
- **📈 Measurable Impact**: Success measured by real-world adoption and effectiveness

### Current Applications:
- **Smart Cities**: AI-powered waste management systems
- **Network Optimization**: SDN solutions for IoT infrastructure
- **User Experience**: QoE models for mobile gaming platforms
- **Education**: Practical big data courses for industry readiness
