# GitHub Profile Setup Instructions

## ðŸš€ Creating Your GitHub Profile Repository

Follow these steps to set up your GitHub profile with the README we created:

### Step 1: Create a Special Repository
1. Go to [GitHub.com](https://github.com) and sign in
2. Click the "+" icon in the top right corner
3. Select "New repository"
4. **Important**: Name the repository exactly as your GitHub username: `skkuhg`
5. Make sure it's **Public**
6. Check "Add a README file" (we'll replace it)
7. Click "Create repository"

### Step 2: Upload Your Files
1. In your new repository, click "uploading an existing file"
2. Drag and drop or select these files:
   - `README.md` (this will replace the default one)
   - `Resume (Gan Huang)1.html`
   - `.gitignore`
   - `project-info.md`
3. Write a commit message: "Initial profile setup with comprehensive README"
4. Click "Commit changes"

### Step 3: Verify Your Profile
1. Go to your GitHub profile: `https://github.com/skkuhg`
2. Your new README should now be displayed as your profile page
3. All the animations, badges, and sections should be visible

### Alternative: Using Git Commands
If you prefer using command line:

```bash
# Navigate to your project folder
cd "c:\Users\ahpuh\Desktop\hg"

# Initialize git repository
git init

# Add all files
git add .

# Make initial commit
git commit -m "Initial profile setup with comprehensive README"

# Add your GitHub repository as remote
git remote add origin https://github.com/skkuhg/skkuhg.git

```
